# Afiyet: A Digital Health Initiative

**Afiyet** is a digital health initiative aimed at supporting underserved communities by providing accessible health education and basic care delivery tools.

Inspired by the concept of **Barefoot Doctors**, the project focuses on empowering local caregivers through a lightweight, mobile-first platform that offers:

- **Basic health training modules** in local languages  
- **Offline-capable tools** for symptom tracking and triage  
- **Integration with remote healthcare professionals** via messaging or low-bandwidth video  
- **Support for traditional and community-based medical practices**

---

The solution is designed to be:

- **Low-cost**
- **Resilient**
- **Scalable** across regions with limited infrastructure

It leverages:

- **Modern web technologies**
- **Cloud services (Azure)**
- **Human-centered design**

To bridge the gap between modern healthcare systems and local realities.
